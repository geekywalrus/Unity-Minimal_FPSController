# Unity-Minimal_FPSController
Slimmed down FPSController based on the Standard Assets provided with Unity (**NO CROSSPLATFORMINPUT**)

## FPSController from Standard Assets without the junk. I changed the script(s) to not require CrossPlatformInput, since I don't currently need such a thing and I'd like to keep this as slim as possible *for my personal use*.

Fork this, steal this, don't do what the license says, whatever. Enjoy.
